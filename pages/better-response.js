            I like that the user who replied tagged the user who asked the question and gave them a good resource to their question. I think what the reply lacks is some of the methods I like to use in community discussions — being a bit more personal and thoughtful to the user and their question. I would also add more detail in the response about how this method of skipping builds relates more directly to the user’s project.
